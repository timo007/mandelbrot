# mandelbrot
Mandelbrot set software written in Fortran. The GUI is written in TclTk.

## Installation

Make sure your system has:

* gfortran (tested with gfortran-6 and gfortran-7; others may work)
* Tcl/Tk  (at least version 8.6; tested with 8.6.8)

Clone the GitHub repository into a local directory on your machine.

* git clone https://github.com/timo007/mandelbrot.git

Change into the mandelbrot/src directory and run the compile shell script.
This will make an executable called mb. There is also a Tcl/Tk script called
mb.tcl. If you start this script, you'll be in the GUI>
